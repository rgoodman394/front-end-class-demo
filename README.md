# Welcome to my Site
## *Rebekah Goodman | 11/21*

Thank you for visiting my project for the Code Louisville Front End Web Development course Fall '21.
When deciding what my project would be on, I thought it would be fun to use my site to display some of 
my photography. Since COVID started last year, I picked up photography (epecially film photography)
as a new (socially-distanced) hobby. I wanted my site to highlight my favorite pictures I've taken, 
as well as help me learn valuable coding skills. 

Here are the elements I picked to build my site:

1. Used a grid with several :nth-child CSS selectors to build responsive photo galleries
2. Constructed a Javascript array to trigger a modal image across three different galleries when an image is clicked
3. Created three toggleable galleries that show/hide using Javascript when a button is pressed
4. Utilized media queries to resize and rearrange elements depending on screensize.

Thanks again for visiting my site!
