How to section your HTML: https://css-tricks.com/how-to-section-your-html/ 
    "Another way to remember this: if you can’t think of a meaningful heading to apply to a <section>, 
    then it probably shouldn’t be a <section>. Use a <div> instead."

    "There is a very important semantic element that I used in the markup above that I haven’t covered yet 
    and that is the <main> element. The <main> element represents the primary content of the page. 
    It is not supposed to feature any side bars or navigation elements in it. 
    You also must not have more than one <main> element on the page unless all other <main> elements 
    on the page have a hidden attribute applied to them (this is for the sake of SPAs)."
